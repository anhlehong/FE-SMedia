## Related Repositories
- **Backend**: [https://github.com/anhlehong/SMedia](https://github.com/anhlehong/SMedia) - The .NET 8.0 backend for Social Network Development. Refer to its README for setup instructions.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the frontend, ensure you have:
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Backend Setup**: The backend repository ([SMedia](https://github.com/anhlehong/SMedia)) must be running and accessible (e.g., at `http://localhost:5000`)
- (Optional) VS Code or another code editor for development

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Frontend Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anhlehong/FE-SMedia.git
   cd FE-SMedia
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the frontend project (`FE-SMedia`) to configure environment variables. Follow these steps:
   - Create the `.env.local` file:
     ```bash
     touch .env.local
     ```
   - Open `.env.local` in a text editor and add the following configuration:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_azure_blob_connection_string
     ```
   - **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL**: Set to the backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` for local development or the deployed backend URL).
   - **NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING**: Obtain from your Azure Blob Storage account. Use the format:
     ```env
     DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your-account-name>;AccountKey=<your-account-key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
     ```
     Replace `<your-account-name>` and `<your-account-key>` with your Azure credentials.
   - **Note**: Do not commit the `.env.local` file to Git; ensure itâ€™s listed in `.gitignore`.

## Running the Application
1. Ensure the backend is running (refer to the backend README for instructions).
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the project configuration).

   **Note**: Ensure the backend API (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) and Azure Blob Storage are accessible before starting the application.

## Testing
Run unit tests to verify the frontend functionality:
```bash
npm run test
```
For continuous testing during development:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run linting to ensure code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

Contributions are welcome! Follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
